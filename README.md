# Hidden Markov Model Analyzer

##Synopsis

This was a small project to implement the [Viterbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm) and [Forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_algorithm)
algorithms on a hidden Markov model represented by four matrices, input as comma-separated files.

The CSV-parser itself was an exercise in writing an explicit finite-state machine to read the input files in to memory.
